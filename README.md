# RoboSwarm
A proof-of-concept project for GPU accelerated 3D physic collision for LÖVE game engine using layers of textures to track occupancy and collision of 1000 agents.

## Principle
A proof of concept of a volumetric 3D physics collision simulation using layers of textures and fragment shaders to update the data.<>
Similar to other of my projects, I use a double-buffered texture to store the particle data and update it every cycle.
